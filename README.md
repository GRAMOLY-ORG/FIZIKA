# FIZIKA

[FIZIKA](https://fizika.gramoly.org/) is a free annual competition meant for individuals at any stage that consists of the creative application of high school physics concepts. We aim to introduce learners to some unconventional applications of theory, hone up their problem-solving aptitude and expand their critical thinking, which in turn will make them better problem solvers. Furthermore, We love sharing some exciting problems with learners.
