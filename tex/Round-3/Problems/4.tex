\begin{problem}

The following problem has two parts, writing the algorithm and then programming it.
\end{problem}


\begin{subpr}{\hfill 10 pts.} Using the expression for the force between a charge and a metal sphere. First, write how one can compute the electrostatic force between two metal balls of radius $r_1$ and $r_2$, charged with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ respectively, in free space, with the distance between their centres being $d$. (The actual computation may be tedious.)

Say this force is $F$ Consider the following dimensionless quantities: 
$$f=\frac{4 \pi \epsilon_0 d^2}{{q_1}^2}\cdot F$$
$$u=\frac{r_1}{d}$$
$$v=\frac{r_2}{d}$$
$$p=\frac{q_1}{q_2}$$
Express all equations in the above procedure in terms of these dimensionless quantities.

Write a program in any language (Python, C, etc.) to compute $f$ given $u,v,p.$ The maximum uncertainty in $f$ from the calculation must not be more than $\approx 1\%$ for $p \approx 1$ $u  \approx v \approx 0.5.$
